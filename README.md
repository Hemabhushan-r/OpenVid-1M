Text-to-video (T2V) generation has recently garnered significant attention, largely due to the advanced multi-modality model, Sora. However, current T2V generation in research community still faces two major challenges: 1) The absence of a precise, high-quality open-source dataset. Previous popular video datasets, such as WebVid-10M and Panda-70M, are either of low quality or too large for most research institutions. Collecting precise, high-quality text-video pairs is both challenging and essential for T2V generation. 2) Inadequate utilization of textual information. Recent T2V methods focus on vision transformers, employing a simple cross-attention module for video generation, which falls short of thoroughly extracting semantic information from text prompt.
To address these issues, we introduce OpenVid-1M, a high-quality dataset with expressive captions. This open-scenario dataset comprises over 1 million text-video pairs, facilitating T2V generation research. Additionally, we curate 433K 1080p videos from OpenVid-1M to create OpenVidHD-0.4M, advancing high-definition video generation. Furthermore, we propose a novel Multi-modal Video Diffusion Transformer (MVDiT), capable of extracting structural information from visual tokens and semantic information from text tokens. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of OpenVid-1M over previous datasets and the effectiveness of our MVDiT.
